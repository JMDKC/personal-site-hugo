I'm an Agile-first project manager who helps product and tech teams work together, better.

I currently lead the Delivery Management team at [Which?](https://which.co.uk), the UK's consumer champion. Previously, I worked at [Ascential](https://www.ascential.com/), a FTSE 250-listed media company. I started on my - far from complete - journey to Agile via [General Assembly](/media/josephclift_GA_certificate.pdf), having previously worked as a financial journalist. Since then, I've deepened my education with [PMI-ACP](/media/josephclift_PMI-ACP_certificate.pdf), [PSM1](/media/josephclift_PSMI_certificate.pdf) (scrum), [PK1](/media/josephclift_PK1_certificate.pdf) (Kanban) and [PRINCE2](/media/josephclift_PRINCE2_practitioner_certificate.pdf) qualifications. And I learn every day on the job, of course.

I've helped teams at Which? achieve a big variety of things, both in Agile squads and in hybrid programmes: from complex CRM migrations involving multiple third party vendors to [a company-wide rebrand](https://www.creativereview.co.uk/which-rebrand/). Prior to that, with live events hammered by the global pandemic, I helped guide the [Cannes Lions festival](https://canneslions.com), aka the Oscars of advertising, to its most successful ever digital activation. And I led development on the [WARC Rankings](https://www.warc.com/rankings), one of the industry’s most widely-known ranking and benchmarking products.

I hold an MA from the University of Bristol. I write about visual art each week on my other website, [Artangled](http://artangled.com). I write about everything else I’m interested in here. Offline, I’m an avid bibliophile and traveller.
