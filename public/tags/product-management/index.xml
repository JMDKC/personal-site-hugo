      <title>Waterfall or straw man?</title>

      <description>The whole Waterfall vs Agile comparison is a sham. It isn&amp;rsquo;t two competing ways of doing things. The Waterfall approach has never had serious support - not even from the inventor of the concept.
So many blogs, tweets and Medium posts about Agile have drawn the comparison over recent years. On one side, there&amp;rsquo;s the old bad Waterfall way of doing things - with bloated planning phases, long lead times, no user feedback, big releases, and no improvements to the initial delivery afterwards.</description>

      <title>PSM1... and done</title>

      <description>So it’s done. After several weeks of reading a 19-page PDF file over and over, taking practice tests and reading countless blog posts, you can now, officially, call me master. Scrum Master. I got certified!
I’d have thought that would have come from the day job, where I work on two Scrum teams, but studying for the PSM1 Scrum Master certification actually underlined how little I knew about the guidelines of this process.</description>

      <title>Epic documentation</title>

      <description>It’s right there in the Agile Manifesto: today’s product teams should prioritise “working software over comprehensive documentation”.
A nice thought. But having notched up several years of working with Agile teams, I feel like these five words have led to an unfortunate belief taking hold among certain zealots: that we don’t need documentation at all!
Which is nonsense. We need the leanest, briefest, most maintainable documentation possible. But we need documentation all the same.</description>

      <title>Stop being a Product Martyr!</title>

      <description>“Being a product manager means that you have a lot of responsibility, but no authority.”
This simple statement has the ring of truth to me. I found it in Matt LeMay’s really useful book, ‘Product Management Fundamentals‘. Here’s how I feel about the responsibility/authority divide.
A good product manager multitasks a lot. And feels stretched. You tend to feel like a “jack of all trades, master of none”. And no wonder, because you spend so much of your time talking to people a lot more expert than you!</description>

      <title>Yes we Kanban!</title>

      <description>Kanban is one of the most talked-about, but least-understood, ways we have of managing digital product development. At least, that’s the impression I got from a recent talk given by David Lowe, a Kanban expert and Scrum coach, at General Assembly in London.
A quick Google search suggests that Kanban has something to do with improving production processes in Japanese car factories. But a look around the blogosphere shows it’s since been sucked into the Agile/Scrum/Lean vortex that powers so much product discussion these days.</description>
