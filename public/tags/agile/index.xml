      <description>This week, I got PMI-ACP certified, which involved taking and passing an exam. In the past couple of months, I put together this Agile glossary as a study aid. It’s an A-Z of Agile concepts, frameworks… and buzzwords. The information is based heavily on the study guide and online learning path I used. I hope it helps others studying for the exam, or can maybe be used as a more general reference tool.</description>
