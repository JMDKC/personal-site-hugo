      <description>By common consensus, tightly integrated campaigns, broadcast across multiple media, are more effective than &amp;ldquo;non-integrated&amp;rdquo; campaigns, which either advertise on a single channel or take a laissez-faire approach to merging channels. But new research - commissioned by the IPA, based on analysis of 250 case studies from IPA Databank, and published in an upcoming book - challenges this point of view.
It seems that, on hard business metrics such as market share changes, loosely integrated campaigns actually perform better than campaigns that are integrated around a central communication idea.</description>
