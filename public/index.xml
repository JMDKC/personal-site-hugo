      <title>Who is Diamond Geezer?</title>

      <description>I was interested to see that Diamond Geezer, one of the best bloggers to have ever blogged, celebrated his twentieth blogiversary the other day. Despite me reading more of his work than any other author I can think of in terms of word count at least, I really don’t have a clue who he is.
This apex predator of Blogspot publishes around 1,100 words per day, up from around 600 a day in the early years.</description>

      <title>An Agile glossary</title>
      <link>https://josephclift.com/writing/an-agile-glossary/</link>

      <description>This week, I got PMI-ACP certified, which involved taking and passing an exam. In the past couple of months, I put together this Agile glossary as a study aid. It’s an A-Z of Agile concepts, frameworks… and buzzwords. The information is based heavily on the study guide and online learning path I used. I hope it helps others studying for the exam, or can maybe be used as a more general reference tool.</description>

      <title>Four steps to clean cleaning</title>
      <link>https://josephclift.com/writing/clean-cleaning/</link>

      <description>I made some changes to the way I clean my flat a couple of months ago: scaling back on the number of products I use, mixing my own cleaners from bulk-bought ingredients, and buying most of the rest from an enlightened manufacturer I want to support. My flat’s as clean as before, I&amp;rsquo;ve reduced the environmental impact of my cleaning and I’ll save money over the long term.
While some of the new products and techniques were more successful than others, overall I haven’t looked back from making the change.</description>

      <title>Waterfall or straw man?</title>
      <link>https://josephclift.com/writing/waterfall-strawman/</link>

      <guid>https://josephclift.com/writing/waterfall-strawman/</guid>
      <description>The whole Waterfall vs Agile comparison is a sham. It isn&amp;rsquo;t two competing ways of doing things. The Waterfall approach has never had serious support - not even from the inventor of the concept.
So many blogs, tweets and Medium posts about Agile have drawn the comparison over recent years. On one side, there&amp;rsquo;s the old bad Waterfall way of doing things - with bloated planning phases, long lead times, no user feedback, big releases, and no improvements to the initial delivery afterwards.</description>

      <description>So it’s done. After several weeks of reading a 19-page PDF file over and over, taking practice tests and reading countless blog posts, you can now, officially, call me master. Scrum Master. I got certified!
I’d have thought that would have come from the day job, where I work on two Scrum teams, but studying for the PSM1 Scrum Master certification actually underlined how little I knew about the guidelines of this process.</description>

      <title>11 gallery entrances in Paris</title>

      <description>I’ve been lucky during this pandemic. I have kept my job, and can work from home, which is safely isolated and peaceful. No close friends or family have caught the virus, symptomatically at least. All of this can change, of course. I pray it doesn’t.
But, four months in, all I can complain about is a cancelled trip to Paris, originally planned for March. Big wow.
My main hobby is visual art (see side project here), so gallery-going is the main focus of my Paris trips.</description>

      <title>Epic documentation</title>

      <description>It’s right there in the Agile Manifesto: today’s product teams should prioritise “working software over comprehensive documentation”.
A nice thought. But having notched up several years of working with Agile teams, I feel like these five words have led to an unfortunate belief taking hold among certain zealots: that we don’t need documentation at all!
Which is nonsense. We need the leanest, briefest, most maintainable documentation possible. But we need documentation all the same.</description>

      <title>Notes from a march</title>

      <description>I stumbled on today’s People’s Vote march by accident. Totally done in by the endless Brexit news cycle, having pinwheeled over the months and years since the referendum between hope and disillusionment, I’ve recently taken the coward’s way out: avoiding Twitter updates and news in general on the topic.
This meant that I vaguely knew about today’s parliamentary vote and the march, but this vagueness was sufficient for me to plan a Saturday afternoon trip to some West End galleries, which involved getting out at Green Park station.</description>

      <description>I wrote the original version of this post for the Fringe! Queer Film Fest blog. I don’t trust them to pay their hosting bill, so I’m reposting it here.
I was a naive 8-year-old, sneakily watching taped-off-the-TV video nasties round my friend Paul’s house, in the far outskirts of London at the fag end of the 1980s. That’s when I first lost my mind to the Nightmare on Elm Street series - and its razor-fingered star, Freddy Krueger.</description>

      <description>Feeling deadline-induced stress, along with the vague sense that you don’t do enough with your evenings that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve said stress? I did, until I started weekly sessions at Out to Swim, an LGBT+ swimming club with classes in London and Brighton.
I hadn’t swum for 20 years before joining the club a few months back. Now, I leave a brightly-lit council-run pool in Elephant and Castle each Wednesday night with a definite spring in my step, the day’s worries forgotten.</description>

      <description>It’s always a pain when an ad isn’t worthy of what’s being advertised. Which is why seeing this spot from Monzo the other day felt like a particularly hard kick to the stomach.
Here’s why I’m about to be highly dramatic and over-critical about a tiny poster on a train. Monzo is the bank that has basically changed my life since switched my main current account there last year, due to its extreme convenience - all in the app!</description>

      <description>I wish I were Amanda Lepore - as Drag Race season 4 winner Sharon Needles sang that one time .
Anyone who sees I Hate New York - showing as part of Fringe at 3.30pm on Sunday 18 November - might find themselves wishing the same.
Gustavo Sánchez’s documentary, shot over a 10 year period, tells the story of Amanda, her ex-club kid frenemies Sophia Lamar, Chloe Dzubilo and T De Long - and the city they live in.</description>

      <description>What’s the value exchange between me and Google?
Not to sound pompous, but this is one of the governing questions of my online life. But I didn’t give it a second thought until I noticed a few disappearing yellow stars.
Do you know about the cult of the stars, flags and hearts? For initiates, it’s one of the most useful bits of one of Google’s most useful apps. Which is kind of like saying one of the most lofty crags on Everest or hottest spots on the sun, considering the Mountain View-based tech behemoth’s terrifyingly high standards of utility.</description>

      <title>132 Days of Duolingo</title>

      <description>I spend around 10 minutes a day on Duolingo and I’m not convinced it’s worth it.
And the fact these doubts only started occurring to me after I completed a 100 day streak on this maddeningly well-designed and moreish app is… annoying.
Admittedly, 10 minutes a day isn’t a massive time commitment. But, over 100 days, that equals almost 17 hours. Most of a day! Is it even time well spent?</description>

      <title>The four types of agency-client relationships</title>

      <guid>https://josephclift.com/writing/four-types-of-agency/</guid>
      <description>Agency/client relationships are getting ever more fraught these days: you only had to look at this week’s announcement from WPP that its sales are taking a big whack, and ominous signals from big advertisers like P&amp;amp;G that they wish to “reinvent” their agency relationships – which will, safe to say, involve paying them a lot less.
If such relationships are getting a bit abusive these days, then, Anselmo Ramos, founder of the WPP-owned, Ogilvy-affiliated agency DAVID, is here to help.</description>

      <description>“Being a product manager means that you have a lot of responsibility, but no authority.”
This simple statement has the ring of truth to me. I found it in Matt LeMay’s really useful book, ‘Product Management Fundamentals‘. Here’s how I feel about the responsibility/authority divide.
A good product manager multitasks a lot. And feels stretched. You tend to feel like a “jack of all trades, master of none”. And no wonder, because you spend so much of your time talking to people a lot more expert than you!</description>

      <description>I went to a lot of art shows in 2017. I don’t really know why this obsession took hold.
It’s definitely an obsession by now though. My weird compulsion to track and quantify my cultural consumption – by making searchable notes about each show attended, film watched and book read on a Google Sheet – proves it.
My inability to set time aside for reading books hasn’t changed: according to the spreadsheet, in 2017, I read frankly pathetic 22 titles, most of which were trashy non-fiction.</description>

      <description>“What we are seeing today is a backwash from what happened 10 years ago.”
So claimed former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, in an event organised by the RSA and held in London a couple of months ago. Darling was in charge of the nation’s finances when the biggest financial crisis in a generation hit in 2007. He articulated a view that has been forming with the recent political ructions and rise of populism.</description>

      <description>The painter Giorgio Morandi lived at 36 via Fondazza, in a quiet corner of Bologna. Morandi, a painter of calming yet weirdly intense still lives, had a reputation for obscurity, separation, reclusiveness. But the address is world famous: so much so that it’s been converted into a museum, open to the public for a couple of hours a week.
Three rooms in the apartment are glassed off, preserved as they were when the artist lived.</description>

      <description>Aside from my day-to-day tasks as a product manager, my big work project over the past year has been WARC’s new Future of Strategy report, which I conceived, researched and (finally) wrote. While it was a real passion project, it was also based on a big user need: the company’s hardcore fans are planners at ad and media agencies, yet within the marketing industry as a whole, the planning discipline is little-understood and often overlooked.</description>

      <description>With so many heart-warming, CSR-led ads winning awards these days, setting a purpose seems to have become almost a prerequisite for launching a big brand campaign.
But many in adland would say these wins are due more to tugging on judges’ heartstrings rather than demonstrating great creativity or solid business results. Or even a sensible purpose in the first place!
This debate came into sharp focus at the Cannes Lions this year, according to a new analysis released by WARC.</description>

      <description>The homeless have always featured in the stories Londoners tell. From doomed Jo in Bleak House, to John Healy’s mid-century memoir The Grass Arena, to the early 70s cult BBC TV movie Edna The Inebriate Woman, the city’s vagrants have worried and perplexed their more fortunate fellow citizens.
Most recently, Alan Bennett’s 1999 play The Lady In The Van, which told the story of the playwright’s 15-year friendship with a homeless woman – a Miss Shepherd – who moved into a van in his Primrose Hill garden, has been adapted for a “cosily enjoyable” movie released this winter.</description>

      <description>Kudos to APG London for its new Thinking Around Corners series of events, one of which I attended the other week. The format’s simple, get three strategists in a room, and get their advice on cracking some challenging briefs.
The standout for me was a problem that’s always bedevilled advertisers with a message to get across: once you get people’s attention, how do you keep it?
How do you get people to concentrate on one thing for more than a minute?</description>

      <description>I’d arrived in Trieste on a Friday evening, and, having dropped my backpack off, I needed to walk. So I set off, towards the sea.
Despite being a Friday, there was almost nobody about. The large, square Hapsburg buildings loomed for block after block at each intersection.
Trieste had been the Austro-Hungarian empire’s biggest seaport, a place of huge grandeur and wealth. Then, one imperial power had been replaced by another: Italian troops marched in at the end of the First World War, and had never left.</description>

      <description>The beginning of the end of my 2016 came when I spent three days in Athens, alone. I went to the city with barely any preparation, beyond half-remembered Greek myths at school, an almost totally forgotten Homer course at university, a scrawled sheet of phrases (‘mee-LA-tay ag-lee-KA’?) and a cut-price air ticket for a midweek, mid-December getaway.
This lack of preparation turned out to be a good idea. Because everything came as a surprise.</description>

      <description>One thing’s for sure: digital media has been blamed for a lot of society’s ills. And that’s despite its massive - and increasing - global popularity, with one piece of research showing that we touch our phones an average of 2,500 times daily, with 80% of our time spent on just five apps.
Two of digital&amp;rsquo;s most-popular by-products, social media and gaming, were put under the microscope by a series of speakers at Unfolded, an event organised by London-based creative agency Fold7 and held yesterday night.</description>

      <description>I met Peggy first. We fell into step, two Brits abroad, dragging our carry-on luggage across the orbital road of Nice airport, walking to the hotel we had been sent to by our airline.
Our evening flight had been delayed, and they’d finally given up for the night. We’d be on the first flight to Heathrow the next morning. An air traffic control failure in Brussels caused the original problem. Appropriately timed: it was June 24th, the night following the Brexit vote.</description>

      <description>It was a normal winter&amp;rsquo;s evening on London&amp;rsquo;s worst street. Just out of the office, I walked towards Oxford Circus, up from the Centre Point end, where the tourist tat shops selling Union Jack keyrings, hoodies and wheelie suitcases give way to the fast-fashion chain stores. I began to cross the road, around the point I’d crossed hundreds of times before, on hundreds of previous commutes home.
A sudden charge in the atmosphere: a bike and a car were approaching, and the car was accelerating quite a bit, right behind the bike.</description>

      <description>Every day in London, thousands of fingers tap a cute Kangaroo logo on their smartphone screens. As a result, every lunchtime and supper time, thousands of young men have a job to do.
They’re participating in a new, digitally-enabled form of freelance labour: working for Deliveroo, the city’s number one takeaway app. Their job is to deliver food, on motorbikes and push bikes, toting huge, insulated square food-storage backpacks, branded with Deliveroo’s turquoise and black corporate colours.</description>

      <description>Sunday family trips to the National Gallery in London are among my most-cherished childhood memories.
Up from our distant suburb beyond the edge of the District line, near Heathrow, being in town was a rare treat. The Gallery was free, and money was an issue for us. It was the 80s, early 90s at the latest, so the Trafalgar Square the Gallery faced was still pigeon-filled and traffic-clogged and grimy. It was wintry and raining outside, probably.</description>

      <description>Another London: looking up Tottenham Court Road, 1974.
The city at its grimiest (and emptiest). Note the wonky railings and hump in the pavement on the near side, and the pedestrian crossing to nowhere on the other side. And the strip of single-story lean-tos, rapid rebuilds after the previous buildings were bombed out in the war; they lasted all the way to the mid-90s, apparently.
Another country: the &amp;ldquo;three-day week&amp;rdquo; and petrol rationing had bitten in earlier in the year; the Common Market referendum was a year away; the IMF bailout came in 1976.</description>

      <description>My mum’s finally finished clearing out my grandparents’ house, and she’s brought back a few boxes of things: books, pieces of jewellery, notes. Nothing valuable, just mementoes. It was a long process, partly as they lived out in the western Highlands near Oban. But it got done eventually, after a lot of trips to the local dump and Oxfam. We accumulate so much stuff.
She had brought down a box of crockery.</description>

      <description>I read less than I used to, and I forget most of what I read. A fact brought home to me last year when, bored at Christmas time, back at my parents’ house, I rifled through some shelves in my childhood bedroom, and pulled out a plain blue hardcover notebook.
I’d found an old reading journal, each line of the notebook had a ‘date begun’ and a ‘date finished’ for each book I read.</description>

      <description>Kanban is one of the most talked-about, but least-understood, ways we have of managing digital product development. At least, that’s the impression I got from a recent talk given by David Lowe, a Kanban expert and Scrum coach, at General Assembly in London.
A quick Google search suggests that Kanban has something to do with improving production processes in Japanese car factories. But a look around the blogosphere shows it’s since been sucked into the Agile/Scrum/Lean vortex that powers so much product discussion these days.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to work back from Apple to give brand advice to Kleenex…
So said Laurence Green, ex of the Cadbury’s Gorilla, and currently of creative agency 101 London, at an APG/Flamingo debate I attended the other day.
The debate was all about “brand love”. Specifically, about the kicking that controversial metric comes in for in ‘How Brands Grow‘. (More proof that, despite being published five years ago, Australian academic Byron Sharp’s magnum opus remains that rarest of things: a talked-about marketing book.</description>

      <description>Last month, I had the chance to interview planning superbrains Toby Harrison and Les Binet of adam&amp;amp;eveDDB.
That’s the agency responsible for Christmas ad hits from this subversive online-only spot for bag brand Mulberry…
To the ongoing series of sentimental, lushly-produced spots for John Lewis: a rare example of an ad that becomes part of the national conversation.
“It feels like Christmas advertising is where it’s hot now,” Binet said.</description>

      <description>I go to a lot of marketing conferences. Which means I sit through an awful lot of marketing pitches and presentations. But, until last month, I hadn’t sat through a single one that made me reassess how I lived my life.
Becky Rowe, managing director at ESRO, a market research company, changed all this at Customers Exposed, an event organised by the Market Research Society. Her subject was one that plays out in the background of the minds of most people with an internet connection (that’ll be just under 3bn people): the nature and value of online friendships.</description>

      <description>As part of a (very entertaining) talk at a Warc event earlier this week, Ogilvy vice-chairman (and ex-head of the IPA) Rory Sutherland argues that ad people have been exploring System One and System Two thinking for years: way before the terms were coined by Daniel Kahneman.
The man himself is obviously having a bit of a moment among adland in general, having been namechecked at basically every marketing event I&amp;rsquo;ve been to this year.</description>

      <description>The video above’s one I shot back in Cannes with Martin Weigel, head of planning at W+K Amsterdam. He’s talking about his beef with the word “content” (mainly definitional). I was reminded of it when, via Twitter, I stumbled across his blogpost on which marketing buzzwords he particularly dislikes, “content” among them.
Content. Also known as ‘branded content’. You mean spots? Oh, sorry, long spots. No? Oh, music videos? No?</description>

      <description>I helped launch the inaugural Warc 100 today. It&amp;rsquo;s a ranking of the world’s best campaigns based on their performance in effectiveness and strategy competitions over the past year. And our top-ranked campaign – and clear winner – was &amp;lsquo;Vodafone Fakka&amp;rsquo;, from JWT Cairo for Vodafone.
This campaign, which promoted micro recharge cards, used a cultural insight: in Egypt, shopkeepers often substitute small change for low-value items. So, they positioned the micro credit recharge card as &amp;lsquo;Fakka&amp;rsquo; – small change, handed out in place of these low-value items, and kept alongside the counter in shops.</description>

      <description>McCann took the Creative Effectiveness Grand Prix in Cannes this year with a campaign that tapped into a universal family dynamic: parents living in the sticks, children living in the city.
The big problem: how to get the kids to come and visit their parents more often. The big insight McCann had for their client, V/Line, a train operator based in Melbourne: why not aim the message at the parents, not the kids?</description>

      <description>Following a winter of what seemed like unbroken rain, there&amp;rsquo;s been a hint of spring in the air these past couple of weeks here in the UK. And the nicer weather&amp;rsquo;s been matched by increased optimism among both British economic and advertising forecasters. Official predictions for 2014 UK GDP growth were revised up to +2.7% earlier this week, suggesting that the economy will at last regain its pre-financial crisis peak this year.</description>

      <description>Getting pricing right is a pretty fraught issue for brand owners. But what should the responsible marketer be doing to make things easier? The Psychology of Price, creative agency Draftfcb&amp;rsquo;s latest Breakfast Club event, held in London this morning, aimed to offer some answers. Behavioural economist Leigh Caldwell, author of a book of the same title as the briefing, and Draftfcb&amp;rsquo;s head of retail Niki Cook both offered their views – and both agreed that price-related decisions go a lot deeper than the actual costs of goods and services.</description>

      <description>There are many ways of defining advertising, but none of them really work on their own. That’s according to no less a source than planning legend Paul Feldwick.
Advertising’s biggest theorisers over history
Here’s why you should believe him. Feldwick – in his role at BMB (later bought by DDB), was responsible for iconic campaigns including the 1990s Barclaycard ads starring Rowan Atkinson. More recently, he’s become something of an industry guru, revered by many (sample ad blogpost title: “Is Paul Feldwick God?</description>

Jouan talked to me about what he terms the Big Lie of marketing – also the title of a new book from Future Foundation.</description>

      <description>Some may deride this idea as corporate greenwashing, but the idea of brands &amp;ldquo;doing good&amp;rdquo; as well as making a profit is becoming an increasingly hot topic. I was struck earlier this month at the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) conference by client after client highlighting the need for brands to have a social &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo;.
With that in mind, today&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;doing good makes for good advertising&amp;rdquo; panel at Advertising Week Europe was very much on trend.</description>

      <description>Or, to put it another way, is advertising success achieved through incremental research, careful checking of data and sound planning – or is it more to do with the creative &amp;ldquo;eureka moment&amp;rdquo;? This &amp;ldquo;science vs art&amp;rdquo; question has troubled advertising&amp;rsquo;s biggest brains for decades. Remember that famous Bill Bernbach quote? &amp;ldquo;Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art.&amp;rdquo;
The industry&amp;rsquo;s latest attempt at settling the matter came with a lively debate at the Edinburgh International Marketing Festival earlier this week.</description>

      <description>Many attendees of the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity pride themselves on being forward thinking. But at this year&amp;rsquo;s event, a lot of minds will be focused on one future date in particular: 27 July 2012, when the summer Olympic Games begin in London. If you want to know why this is, follow the money.
The Olympics are a prime cause of the industry&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;quadrennial effect&amp;rdquo; – the lift given to global adspend every four years due to the happy convergence of major summer sporting events and the US presidential election.</description>

      <description>Eurozone bailouts, signs of a slowdown in China and - perhaps most worrying of all - uncertainty over the raising of the US debt ceiling have all hit the headlines recently. Shockingly poor US GDP data released last week have led some to suggest that the world&amp;rsquo;s largest economy could even be facing a double-dip recession. And, according to Warc&amp;rsquo;s latest International Ad Forecast - now available for subscribers to download - it seems that marketers are taking heed of all the bad news.</description>

      <description>By common consensus, tightly integrated campaigns, broadcast across multiple media, are more effective than &amp;ldquo;non-integrated&amp;rdquo; campaigns, which either advertise on a single channel or take a laissez-faire approach to merging channels. But new research - commissioned by the IPA, based on analysis of 250 case studies from IPA Databank, and published in an upcoming book - challenges this point of view.
It seems that, on hard business metrics such as market share changes, loosely integrated campaigns actually perform better than campaigns that are integrated around a central communication idea.</description>

      <description>Some brands make it big; most do not. But why are certain brands successful in the first place? And why does a still-smaller group of brands remain popular over the long term?
In his 2010 book Brand Relevance: Making Competitors Irrelevant, US academic David A. Aaker attempts to answer these questions. He claims that &amp;ldquo;relevance&amp;rdquo; is a crucial factor in a brand attaining market leadership - and that companies become relevant by creating their own category or subcategory through innovation.</description>

According to new research from RAPP UK, unveiled at its Opportunity in Austerity briefing in London, cash-strapped Britons, faced with the economy&amp;rsquo;s stuttering recovery from its worst recession in decades, are making changes to their lifestyle - including doing more of their shopping at low-cost supermarkets.
After the bling-obsessed boom years, any taboo surrounding low-cost brands was blown away by the economic downturn.</description>

      <description>Neuroscience is here to stay - and the insights it provides can be far more compelling than those from the traditional focus group.
That&amp;rsquo;s been the message from many researchers over recent years, as they use techniques from eye-tracking to FMRI to track the brain&amp;rsquo;s unconscious reactions to various stimuli. And it&amp;rsquo;s a message that was brought home once more by Gemma Calvert, founder of Neurosense, at a meeting of the Account Planners Group in London last night.</description>

      <description>Societies are always changing - and being able to predict accurately how societies will change in the years ahead is a matter of acute concern to advertisers. GfK Roper offered some forecasts of its own in its &amp;lsquo;The World to 2020&amp;rsquo; seminar, held in London this week, based on the years of data they&amp;rsquo;ve been gathering from over 30 countries in five continents.
In developed nations at least, people are now interacting with brands more directly than they did before, whether through saying they &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; it on Facebook, through leaving product reviews on Amazon or CNET, or through saving money by using mobile services like Voucher Cloud and shopping around for the best deal via price comparison websites.</description>

      <description>John Grant discussed the concept of Co-opportunity - also the title of his latest book, see Warc summary here - with a packed audience of planners at an APG event in London yesterday.
The rise of social media has led to a dramatic shift in power towards consumers and away from brands (and marketers). Grant, a co-founder of St Luke&amp;rsquo;s, sees this process as beneficial rather than destructive. He argues that co-operation can benefit both brands&amp;rsquo; bottom lines and society as a whole.</description>

      <description>Online display ads don&amp;rsquo;t tend to be a big part of the typical web user&amp;rsquo;s browsing experience. However, they&amp;rsquo;re a lot more important for media buyers and publishers - not least because, over recent years, the automated ad networks that have achieved primacy have driven down CPM rates across the board.
Representatives from both the buy side and the sell side discussed - and disagreed on - how the ads should be monetised, at an AOP event in London which I attended yesterday.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a certified Scrum Master, currently working in digital delivery at Which?, the UK&amp;rsquo;s consumer champion.
Previously, I worked at Ascential, a FTSE 250-listed media company.
With live events hammered by the global pandemic, I helped guide the Cannes Lions festival, aka the Oscars of advertising, to its most successful ever digital activation. Before that, I led development on the WARC 100, now WARC Rankings, one of the industry’s most widely-known ranking and benchmarking products.</description>

      <description>Which? Faulty Goods Tool Part of the important work done by Which?, as the UK&amp;rsquo;s consumer champion, is to empower people to take power into their own hands and assert their rights. One large and little-understood issue is faulty goods: an area in which the buyer has a host of legal rights and protections, but there is little public understanding of these.
Which? offers a free-to-access faulty goods tool, in which the users wanting to reclaim for a faulty product they&amp;rsquo;ve recently bought enter their details, and get a variety of advice, support and a proforma letter to send to their seller.</description>
